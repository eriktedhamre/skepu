There should probably be a simple example on how Element index retrieval works. In the SkePU userguide.

MapReduce is a combination of MapandReduce in sequence and offers the most features of both, for example, only 1D reductions are supported.?

setDefaultSize, there is an explanation, for MapPairsReduce but not one for MapReduce.

Under listing 1.3 the paragraph should finish above the listing

Multiple return types for reduce??
Tried to think about solutions, couldn't include a scalar to a reduce call. Probably should have asked you a question instead of waiting this long.

did a combined max,min and sum operation, then simply divided the sum. One reduce call but feel cheap.
